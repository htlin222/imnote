# Anemia

> ↓ in RBC mass: Hct <41% or Hb <13.5 g/dL (men); Hct <36% or Hb <12 g/dL (women)

### Clinical manifestations

*  Symptoms: ↓ O 2 delivery → fatigue, exertional dyspnea, angina (if CAD)
*  Signs: pallor (mucous membranes, palmar creases), tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension
*  Other findings: jaundice (hemolysis), splenomegaly (thalassemia, neoplasm, chronic hemolysis), petechiae/purpura (bleeding disorder), glossitis (iron, folate, vitamin B 12 defic.), koilonychia (iron defic.), neurologic abnormalities (B 12 defic.)

### Diagnostic evaluation

* History: bleeding, systemic illness, drugs, exposures, alcohol, diet (including pica), FHx
* CBC w/ diff.; RBC params incl. retics, MCV (nb, mixed disorder can → nl MCV), RDW
* Reticulocyte index (RI) = [reticulocyte count × (Pt’s Hct/nl Hct)]/maturation factor maturation factors for a given Hct: 45% = 1, 35% = 1.5, 25% = 2, 20% = 2.5 RI >2% → adequate marrow response; RI <2% → hypoproliferation
* Peripheral smear: select area where roughly ⅓ RBCs touch each other; 俶 RBC size, shape, inclusions (see “Appendix” & “Peripheral Smear”), WBC morphology, plt count
* Additional labs as indicated: hemolysis labs (if RI >2%, see below), iron/TIBC, ferritin, folate, B 12 , LFTs, BUN & Cr, TFTs, Hb electrophoresis, enzyme/gene mutation screens • Bone marrow (BM) aspirate and biopsy (bx) with cytogenetics as indicated

![image-20200930135229594](https://i.imgur.com/hgdJd8z.png)

### Iron deficiency (NEJM 2015;372:1832; Lancet 2016;387:907)

* ↓ marrow iron & depleted body iron stores → ↓ heme synthesis → microcytosis → anemia
* Special clinical manifestations: angular cheilosis, atrophic glossitis, pica (consumption of nonnutritive substances such as ice, clay), koilonychia (nail spooning) Plummer-Vinson syndrome (iron deficiency anemia, esophageal web & atrophic glossitis)
* Etiologies: chronic bleeding (GI—incl. cancer, menstrual, parasites, NSAIDs, etc.), ↓ supply (malnutrition; ↓ absorp. due to celiac sprue, Crohn’s, ↑ gastric pH, subtotal gastrectomy), ↑ demand (preg; Blood 2017;129:940). Iron-refractory iron-defic. anemia (IRIDA; rare genetic disorder due to hepcidin dysregulation; Nat Genet 2008;40:569).
* Diagnosis (eval ideally before Rx): ↓ Fe, ↑ TIBC, ↓ ferritin (esp. <15), ↓ transferrin sat (Fe/TIBC; esp. <15%), ↑ soluble transferrin receptor; ↑ plt. Unless hx c/w other etiology, initiate workup for GIB, incl. H. pylori serology. ? Celiac labs (antiTTG, antigliadin, anti-endomysial Abs). Cytogenetics & molecular testing as indicated.
* Treatment: oral Fe tid (~6 wks to correct anemia; ~6 mo to replete Fe stores; nb, oral Fe does not give Ͱ Hemoccult). In excessive/persistent GI losses or dialysis, cancer, CHF, or prior to Epo Rx, IV iron (Fe-sucrose, -gluconate, -dextran) should be considered.

### Thalassemias (Lancet 2018;391:155)

* ↓ synthesis of α- or β-globin chains of Hb → ≠ subunits → destruction of RBCs and erythroid precursors; ħ anemia from hemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis
*  α-thalassemia (NEJM 2014;371:1908): deletions in α-globin gene complex (nl 4 α genes), seen w/ Southeast Asian, Mediterranean, African, Middle East ancestry 3 α → α-thal-2 trait = silent carrier; 2 α → α-thal-1 trait or αthal minor = mild anemia 1 α → HbH (β 4 ) disease = severe anemia, hemolysis, and
* splenomegaly 0 α genes → Hb Barts (γ 4 ) = intrauterine hypoxia and hydrops fetalis

* β-thalassemia: mutations in β-globin gene → absent or ↓ gene product seen w/ Mediterranean (espec. Greek or Italian), African, or Asian ancestry 1 mutated β gene → thal minor (or trait) = mild anemia (no transfusions) 2 mutated β genes → thal intermedia (occasional transfusions) or thal major (= Cooley’s anemia; transfusion dependent) depending on severity of mutations
* Special clinical manifestations: chipmunk facies, pathologic fractures, hepatosplenomegaly (due to extramedullary hematopoiesis), high-output CHF, bilirubin gallstones, Fe overload
* Dx: MCV <70, normal Fe, ferritin, MCV/RBC count <13 [Mentzer Index, 60% Se, 98% Sp; (Ann Hem 2007;86:486)], ± ↑ retics, basophilic stippling; Hb electrophoresis: ↑ HbA 2 (α 2 δ 2 ) in β-thal; normal pattern in α-thal trait, ħ PCR or supravital stain for dx 
* Treatment: folate; transfusions + Fe chelator [either deferoxamine (IV) or deferasirox (PO)]; ? splenectomy if ≥50% ↑ in transfusions; consider allo-HSCT in children w/ severe βthal; gene therapy in development (NEJM 2018;378:1479)

### Anemia of chronic inflammation (see below) 

### Sideroblastic anemia

* Defective heme biosynthesis within RBC precursors

* Etiologies: hereditary/X-linked (ALAS2 mutations), idiopathic, MDS-RARS, reversible (alcohol, lead, isoniazid, chloramphenicol, copper deficiency, hypothermia)
* Special clinical manifestations: hepatosplenomegaly, iron overload syndromes
* Dx: social, work & TB hx; can be micro-, normo-, or macrocytic; variable populations of hypochromic RBCs; ↑ Fe, nl TIBC, ↑ ferritin, basophilic stippling, RBC Pappenheimer bodies (Fecontaining inclusions), ring sideroblasts (w/ iron-laden mitochondria) in BM
* Treatment: treat reversible causes; trial of pyridoxine, supportive transfusions for severe anemia with chelation therapy; highdose pyridoxine for some hereditary cases

## NORMOCYTIC ANEMIAS

### Pancytopenia (see below)

### Anemia of chronic inflammation (ACI; NEJM 2012;366:4)

* ↓ RBC production due to impaired iron utilization and functional iron deficiency from ↑ hepcidin; cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α) cause ↓ Epo responsiveness/production
* Etiologies: autoimmune disorders, chronic infection, inflammation, HIV, malignancy
* Dx: ↓ Fe, ↓ TIBC (usually normal or low transferrin sat), ± ↑ ferritin; usually normochromic, normocytic (~70% of cases) but can be microcytic if prolonged
* Coexisting iron deficiency common. Dx clues include ↓ serum ferritin levels, absence of iron staining on BM bx, Ͱ response to a trial of oral iron and/or ↑ soluble transferrin receptor/ferritin index (Am J Clin Pathol 2012;138:642).
* Treatment: treat underlying disease ± iron and/or erythropoiesisstimulating agent (ESA; eg, Epo). Iron if ferritin <100 or Fe/TIBC <20%. Consider ESA if Epo <500. Avoid ESA in cancer if treatment goal is cure (Lancet 2009;373:1532). Transfuse PRBCs only if symptomatic & insufficient time to wait for response to Epo or underlying disease Rx.

### Anemias of other chronic disorders

* Anemia of chronic kidney disease: ↓ Epo; treat w/ Epo (see “Chronic Kidney Disease”)
* Endocrine deficiencies: hypometabolism and ↓ O 2 demand with thyroid, pituitary, adrenal, or parathyroid disease → ↓ Epo; can be normocytic or macrocytic

### Sideroblastic anemia (see above)

### Pure red cell aplasia

* Destructive antibodies or lymphocytes → ineffective erythropoiesis
* Associated with thymoma, CLL and parvovirus infection, autoimmunity, drugs
* Diagnostic studies: lack of erythroid precursors on BM bx, other lines normal
* Treatment: thymectomy if thymus enlarged; IVIg if parvovirus and immunosuppressed (Clin Infect Dis 2013;56:968); immunosuppression/chemoRx if CLL or idiopathic; supportive care w/ PRBC transfusions; ? erythropoietin receptor agonist if due to antierythropoietin Ab (NEJM 2009;361:1848) consider hematopoietic cell transplantation.

## MACROCYTIC ANEMIAS

> includes megaloblastic and nonmegaloblastic causes

### Megaloblastic anemia 

*  Impaired DNA synthesis → cytoplasm matures faster than nucleus → ineffective erythropoiesis and macrocytosis; due to folate or B 12 deficiency; also in MDS
* ✔ folate and vitamin B12; ↑ LDH & indirect bilirubin (due to ineffective erythropoiesis) 
* Smear: neutrophil hypersegmentation, macro-ovalocytes, anisocytosis, poikilocytosis

### Folate deficiency

* Folate present in leafy green vegetables and fruit; total body stores sufficient for 2–3 mo

• Etiologies: malnutrition (alcoholics, anorectics, elderly), ↓ absorption (sprue), impaired metabolism (methotrexate, pyrimethamine, trimethoprim; NEJM 2015;373:1649), ↑ requirement (chronic hemolytic anemia, pregnancy, malignancy, dialysis)

• Diagnosis: ↓ folate; ↓ RBC folate, ↑ homocyst. but nl methylmalonic acid (unlike B 12 defic.)

• Treatment: folate 1–5 mg PO qd for 1–4 mo or until complete hematologic recovery; critical to r/o B 12 deficiency first (see

below)

Vitamin B

12

deficiency (NEJM 2013;368:149)

• B

12

present only in foods of animal origin; total body stores

sufficient for 2–3 y

• Binds to intrinsic factor (IF) secreted by gastric parietal cells; absorbed in terminal ileum

• Etiologies: malnutrition (alcoholics, vegans), pernicious anemia (PA, autoimmune disease against gastric parietal cells, a/w polyglandular endocrine insufficiency and ↑ risk of gastric carcinoma), other causes of ↓ absorption (gastrectomy, sprue, Crohn’s disease), ↑ competition (intestinal bacterial overgrowth, fish tapeworm)

• Clinical manifestations: neurologic changes (subacute combined degeneration) affecting peripheral nerves, posterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord and cortex → numbness, paresthesias, ↓ vibratory and positional sense, ataxia, dementia

• Dx: ↓ B 12 ; ↑ homocysteine and methylmalonic acid; anti-IF Ab;

Schilling test; ↑ gastrin in PA • Treatment: 1 mg B 12 IM qd × 7 d → q wk × 4–8 wk → q month

for life neurologic abnormalities are reversible if treated w/in 6 mo folate can reverse hematologic abnormalities of B 12 deficiency but not neurologic changes (and can lead to “steal” of B

12

stores → worsening of neuro complications) oral supplementation (2 mg qd) appears feasible as well (Cochrane Rev CD004655) even w/o IF

Nonmegaloblastic macrocytic anemias

• Liver disease: often macrocytic, may see target cells, or spur cell anemia w/ hemolysis

• Alcoholism: BM suppression & macrocytosis independent of folate/B 12 defic. or cirrhosis

• Reticulocytosis

• Other causes: hypothyroidism; MDS; meds that impair DNA synthesis (zidovudine, 5-FU, hydroxyurea, Ara-C); hereditary orotic aciduria; Lesch-Nyhan syndrome

## PANCYTOPENIA

Etiologies

• Hypocellular bone marrow (nl cellularity ~100 – age): aplastic anemia, hypoplastic MDS

• Cellular bone marrow: MDS, aleukemic leukemia, PNH, severe megaloblastic anemia

• Marrow replacement (myelophthisis): myelofibrosis, metastatic solid tumors, granulomas

• Systemic diseases: hypersplenism, sepsis, alcohol, toxins

Clinical manifestations

• Anemia → fatigue

• Neutropenia → recurrent infections

• Thrombocytopenia → mucosal bleeding & easy bruisability

Aplastic anemia = stem cell failure (NEJM 2015;373:35)

• Epidemiology: 2–5 cases/10 6 /y; biphasic (major peak in adolescents, 2 nd peak in elderly)

• Diagnosis: pancytopenia w/ ↓ retics, BM bx w/ cytogenetics showing hypocellularity

• Etiologies: idiopathic ( 1 / 2 – 2 / 3 of cases)

Stem cell destruction: radiation, chemotherapy, chemicals (eg, benzene) Idiosyncratic med rxn (eg, chloramphenicol, NSAIDs, sulfa

drugs, gold, carbamazepine, antithyroid)

Viruses (HHV-6, HIV, EBV, parvovirus B19); post-viral hepatic failure (not Hep A/B/C) Immune disorders (SLE, GVHD post-HSCT, thymoma) PNH (see below); Fanconi’s anemia (congenital disorder w/

pancytopenia, macrocytic anemia, ↑ risk of MDS, AML, &

SCC of head & neck, and multiple physical anomalies) Shortened telomeres: seen w/ telomerase (TERT, TERC) mut.

(10% of aplastic anemia), dyskeratosis congenita/DKC1

mut; a/w IPF, cirrhosis (NEJM 2009;361:2353) Somatic mutations: PNH clones in ~50% of aplastic anemia

(Haematologica 2010;95:1075)

• Treatment and prognosis Allogeneic HSCT: for young Pts → ~80% long-term survival and significantly ↓ risk of malignant evolution, but has risk of transplant-related morbidity & mortality; if possible, avoid transfusions (and alloimmunization) pretransplant Immunosuppression (CsA/tacrolimus, ATG): 70–80% respond, with 80–90% 5-y survival in responders (96% vs. 76% w/ horse vs. rabbit ATG; NEJM 2011;365:430); 1520% 10-y incidence of clonal disorders (mostly MDS, AML, PNH) TPO mimetics (eg, eltrombopag) use 1 st -line w/ immunosuppression (NEJM 2017;376:1540) Supportive care: transfusions, abx, possible utility of G-CSF & Epo (if Epo <500)

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) (qv)

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) (Blood

2009;113:6522)

• Acquired clonal stem cell disorder = inactivating somatic mutation of PIG-A gene → deficiency of GPI-anchor for CD55 & CD59 (inhib of complement) → complement-mediated RBC lysis, plt aggreg., & hypercoagulability

• Clinical: intravascular hemolytic anemia, hypercoagulability (venous > arterial; esp. intraabdominal, cerebral), smooth muscle dystonias, deficient hematopoiesis (cytopenias); a/w aplastic anemia, MDS and evolution to AML

• Dx: flow cytometry (↓ CD55 & CD59) on RBCs and granulocytes; urine hemosiderosis

• Treatment: supportive care (iron, folate, transfusions); consider anticoagulation allogeneic HSCT for hypoplasia or severe thrombosis eculizumab (Ab inactivates terminal complement C5s): ↓

hemolysis, improves QoL & stabilizes Hb levels (NEJM

2004;350:552 & 2006;355:1233; Lancet 2009;373:759); effective in

pregnancy (NEJM 2015;373:1032); must have meningococcal vaccination

Myelophthisic anemia (see also “Primary Myelofibrosis”) • Infiltration of bone marrow by cancer, leukemia, infection, fibrosis

(primary myelofi- brosis), granulomas, lysosomal storage

• Diagnosis: smear may show RBC Heinz bodies (oxidized Hb) that result in bite cells once removed by spleen; ↓ G6PD levels (may be normal after acute hemolysis because older RBCs have

already lysed and young RBCs may still have near-normal levels)

Sickle cell anemia (NEJM 2017;376:1561 & Lancet 2017;390:311)

• Recessive β-globin mutation → structurally abnl hemoglobin (HbS). ~8% African Americans heterozygotes (“sickle trait”; usually w/o sx); ~1/400 homozygotes (sickle cell disease).

2017;376:939)

• Cold AIHA: IgM Ab binds to RBCs at temp <37°C → complement fixation → intravascular hemolysis and acrocyanosis on exposure to cold Etiologies: idiopathic, lymphoprolif. disorders (eg, Waldenström’s; monoclonal), Mycoplasma pneumoniae infxn and infectious mononucleosis (polyclonal)

• Diagnosis: spherocytes on smear, Ͱ Coombs’; 俶 cold agglutinin titer, splenomegaly

• Treatment (Blood 2017;129:2971): treat underlying disease Warm AIHA: corticosteroids ± splenectomy, IVIg, cytotoxic agents, rituximab Cold AIHA: avoid cold; steroids ineffective; rituximab (Blood

2004;103:2925)

Drug-induced hemolytic anemia • Acquired, Ab-mediated, RBC destruction precipitated by a med.
